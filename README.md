# Blog-page
A professional Blog page website sample frontend and backend 

This hasnt been hosted on internet. It is just a sample project to get the feel of web development.
This project has made use of django, css, html and SQLite.

This project allows the user to sign up and only authenticated users to sign in. Only upon signing in as an authenticated user they would be able to view all the blogs created by them or other users too. It provides security to the blogs by allowing only the authors of the blogs the facility to delete and edit their blogs. We have also sorted the blogs at the home page by their creation so the newest blogs will appear at the top and there is also an exclusive section for recently created blogs which has the top 5 recently created blogs.
